                    I have been fortunate enough to attend two different training

                    instructors
                    </a> were Mike McKerns and Alex Chabot-Leclerc who were
                    highly knowledgeable professionals.
                    The most recent class was

                    Pandas Mastery Workshop,
                    </a> which I would highly recommend.
                    During the course, Alexandre made numerous comments about
                    performance differences, and I wanted to document some
                    surprising methods to speed up

                <h2>Pandas Overhead Costs</h2>

                <p>
                    Pandas has a multitude of well thought out quality
                    methods, but there is a price to pay to get them.
                    A younger version of myself used to think, "Straight up
                    Numpy is good enough for me."
                    I refused to even consider a number of great packages.
                    Now that I've been reformed, one of the key ideas I
                    learned is to use the packages that are out there.
                    When something doesn't seem quite right, it's time to
                    dig a little deeper.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If equivalent operations are performed in Numpy and
                    Pandas, Numpy is clearly faster.

                <h2>Pandas Series Numerical Operations</h2>

                <p>
                    For numerical operations, one would expect Numpy to be
                    faster than Pandas and that is the case.
                    In this section, mathematical addition and multiplication
                    examples employing the optimized methods for each package
                    were used.
                    Later on we'll take a look at an example of when the
                    Pandas mapping function is utilized.
                    The surprising discovery from this round of profiling is
                    that wrapping a Pandas object with a Numpy method provides
                    essentially no performance benefit.
                    It's also interesting to note that the multiplication
                    operator is slightly faster than the addition operator.
                    And yet a bigger surprise still is that converting a
                    Pandas object to a Numpy object, performing a
                    calculation, and then crating a new Pandas object takes
                    less than half the time to just do the calculation in
                    Pandas!

                    The results for Pandas DataFrames are similar to the
                    Series.
                    Again, multiplication is just a bit quicker than
                    addition and the conversion technique provides great
                    improvements in execution time.

                <h2>Aggregate Methods</h2>

                <p>
                    Pandas does have a couple methods built to perform
                    element-wise operations.
                    For Series, there is
                    <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.map.html">
                        map
                    </a>
                    and DataFrames use
                    <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.apply.html">
                        apply
                    </a>
                    and
                    <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.applymap.html">
                        applymap
                    </a>.
                    With the current implementation of these methods, Pandas
                    ends up calling a for loop in Python for map and apply,
                    and a nested for loop in Python for applymap.
                    This is where using the conversion technique could be a
                    game changer.
                    Once in Numpy, the operations are performed in a
                    vectorized manner using optimized C routines.
                    The performance gains will be relative to your array
                    size, and in this case for one million elements there
                    was an increase in speed by more than 400 times!

        <section class="row">

            <div class="col-3-4">

                <h2>Date String Formats</h2>

                <p>
                    If you read the documentation carefully for most of the
                    methods related to importing time in Pandas, you will see
                    there is a fast path for strings formatted in ISO 8601.
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <span>iso_8601_format = 'YYYY-MM-DD'</span>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    The current profiling for this aspect of the code
                    yielded a speed increase of four time just by altering the
                    string format.
                    There are two takeaways here:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            If you are able to control the gathering of date,
                            chose to use the ISO 8601 format.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If you have a large amount of times to convert
                            in Pandas, it may be worth pre-processing them
                            into the ISO 8601 format prior to loading into
                            Pandas.
                        </li>

                    </ol>

                    <li>
                        Pandas does perform slower than Numpy,
                        <em class="warning">but</em>
                        has a ton of really great features.

                            <li>If you haven't given Pandas a try, now is a
                                great time to check it out.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To increase the execution time of numerical
                        operators in Pandas:
                        <ol class="ol-nest">
                            <li>Convert them to Numpy objects</li>
                            <li>Perform the calculation</li>
                            <li>
                                Create a new Pandas object from the Numpy

                    <li>
                        Multiplication operations are slightly faster than
                        addition.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Avoid the use of Pandas map, apply and applymap
                        methods.

                                These implementations end up evaluating
                                element-wise operations in Python for loops
                                and there is a heavy performance penalty.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When dealing with converting strings of dates to
                        be used in Pandas, try to format the string in
                        accordance with ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD).
                        <ol class="ol-nest">
                            <li>
                                Pandas is optimized for this format and that
                                makes your code run faster.
