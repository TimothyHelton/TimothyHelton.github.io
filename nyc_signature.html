                    For this project we are going to place ourselves in the
                    following scenario:
                </p>

                <p>
                    A factious non-profit group called NYC Change,
                    NYC<sup>2</sup>, has contacted our consulting firm to
                    help them obtain signatures for a petition.
                    With enough signatures, our client will get their issue
                    on an upcoming ballot to let the power of the people
                    weigh in on their cause.
                    NYC<sup>2</sup> has a group of eager volunteers lined
                    up to hit the streets and engage the throngs of
                    <em>cheery</em> New Yorkers!
                    Wanting to get the most out of their limited man power,
                    our task is to identify locations and people groups in
                    the city where the engaged citizens will have a
                    predisposition to participate in the democratic process.
                </p>

                <p class="warning">
                    <strong>The stakes are high here!</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    If the volunteers fail to pull in enough signatures,
                    we'll be out on the street corner.
                    So with the stage set, let's get to it and help
                    NYC<sup>2</sup> make a difference.
                </p>

                    To solve any problem you need a game plan, and the
                    following steps are how we're going to determine a
                    solution for NYC<sup>2</sup>.
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Identify people in New York City that have a
                        high probability of wanting to sign a petition.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make an informed decision about locations in
                        the city were our target audience will be found.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Find subway stations near the target locations and
                        analyze the turnstile data to determine times of day
                        to deploy volunteers.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    Who would want to take time out of their busy day to
                    listen for a minute or two and join a cause?
                    I'm willing to bet that people that voted in the last
                    election would.
                </p>
                <p>
                    * Determine location where these people groups would be
                    found.
                    * Identify subway locations near target locations
                    * Look at the subway turnstile data to find probable
                    times when the target groups would be at the subway
                    stations.

                <h2>Demographics</h2>

                <p>
                    As a starting place, let's look at the voting demographics
                    <a href="http://localhost:63342/TimothyHelton.github.io/assets/data/us_age_2016_voter.xls">
                        dataset
                    </a>supplied by the US Census Bureau.
                    The plot below provides a break down of people in the
                    country of reported to <strong>have voted</strong> in 2016.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Statistics are also reported by the Census Bureau for
                    people who reported to have not voted and those who
                    chose to not disclose whether or not they voted.
                    By focusing our attention on the group that chose to
                    report they voted we are evaluating a known quantity and
                    selecting a group that was proud to have voted.
                    Both of these factors should contribute to acquiring
                    more signatures on the petition.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Here are a couple of key points to notice from the data:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Half the people 37 years of age and older voted.</li>
                    <li>
                        Gender is fairly equal, but women tended to vote
                        more than men.
                    </li>
                    <li>The age groups in the 70th percentile and higher
                        for turnout were 45, 46, and 49 through 65.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <br>
                <p>
                    The Census Bureau also supplies an additional
                    <a href="http://localhost:63342/TimothyHelton.github.io/assets/data/states_2016_voter.xls">
                        dataset
                    </a>based only on the voter turnout for New York State.
                    The attributes of this dataset are more focused on
                    people groups than age like the National data above.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Since the total population for each group is supplied by
                    normalizing the positive voters we should be able to
                    give our volunteer a ranked order of whom to pursue.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The key points from this dataset are the following:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The state data confirms our initial findings that
                        women vote slightly more than men.
                    </li>
                    <li>On first glance one might think ok target groups
                        in the following order; White, Black, Hispanic,
                        and then Asian.
                        But, after the uncertainty of the collected data is
                        taken into account the is a near tie at the top
                        between Black and White voter.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <br>
                <h5>Findings</h5>
                <p>
                    After analyzing the 2016 voter turnout statistics we can
                    now define target groups for the volunteers to engage.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Remember that the only features that make the
                        target groups more desirable is the increased
                        probability of having voted in the past.
                    </strong>
                </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Give preference to women over men.</li>
                        <li>Look for people in the age range of 45-65.</li>
                        <li>
                            Approach people groups in the following order:
