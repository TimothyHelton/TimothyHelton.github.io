                    This project will apply machine learning techniques in
                    search of the answers to these questions.
                    "What's the point?", you ask?
                    While singling out historic figures that deserve
                    recognition for their accomplishments would contribute
                    to the game, finding gifted athletes early in their
                    careers would lead to <strong>championships</strong>.

                    There are a couple of obvious paths to learning what
                    traits will result in exceptional players at the
                    professional level.

                        Study players that are already in the Hall of Fame

                    I possessed some talent for the sport of soccer in my
                    young day, but was completely useless at basketball.
                    In lieu of dedicating the second half of my life to
                    the art of round ball let's choose option 2 and see
                    what there is to find in almost 70 years of player
                    statistics.

                    The Naismith Memorial Basketball
                    <a href="http://www.hoophall.com/">Hall of Fame</a>
                    located in Springfield Massachusetts is where the best
                    of the best are enshrined for history.
                    There are a number of different ways to get into the
                    Hall other than being a player as show in the following
                    graphic.
                    Of interest is the fact that there are far fewer coaches
                    at the pro level, but it appears they have a much higher
                    percentage of being selected to join the Hall of Fame
                    than players.
                    One could also argue that getting a coaching appointment
                    on a professional sports team is more difficult than
                    getting in a game.
                    The call on how to perceive that anomaly will be left up
                    to you.

                    An important detail about the Naismith Memorial Basketball
                    Hall of Fame is that it's for all
                    <em><strong>Basketball</strong></em>.
                    This means there are many player subcategories in the Hall.

                    For this project we are concentrating on the inductees
                    that played in the NBA.
                    That means the calibration data sample size is reduced
                    from <strong>167</strong> to <strong>109</strong>.

                    New York State has produced more Hall of Famers than any

                    Countries outside the United States with inductees include
                    Jamaica, Lithuania, Canada, Croatia, France and Nigeria.

                    Another interesting fact about the players is the
                    majority were members of collegiate teams.
                    Until 1971 players had to exhaust four years of college
                    eligibility to join the pros, but the entrance rules
                    have changed multiple times over the years.
                    As of 2006, any player declaring for the draft must be
                    19 years old and one year removed from high school.
